hashbash, so named because it bashes your hashes,will read a line seperated list of SHA1 
hashes and search for them in the constructed rainbow table. It will read these hashes
either from a file provided via the -f command line option or from stdin if -f is not 
passed. A rainbow table can be constructed from a file with the -i option, otherwise
it will be constructed from scratch.


hashbash [ -c <chain-lengh> -r <num-rows> -i <rainbow-file> -f <SHA1-digest-file> ]
